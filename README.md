## Notes on Design

Clicking on any of the triangular tabs should make each tab, except for home, move up and to the left out of the screen. A mostly-opaque white background should overlay the image of my and then the content from each respective tab would then go on top.

Clicking on home would remove content, remove white background, and make tabs re-appear.

They would be black background with white text. Undecided on font. Also unsure how to pull off the CSS to make the triangular tabs work, but I will figure it out.
