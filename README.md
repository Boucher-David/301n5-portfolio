# Class 03 Notes

I have been behind on class-specific work whilst trying to get my svg nav bar to work. It is now responsive and sticks to top left. Clicking on a nav (that isn't home) will hide all the nav bars and load a handlebars template into the main-content class.

I've used pretty specific jQuery selectors to select the nav elements.

Is it worth creating templates for the nav bars?

Next on the list is creating basic SMACCS styling for .main-content and working on a data template for the various handlebar templates. More to come.
