# Portfolio 10 & 11 @ 12

Completed 10, 11, and 12. I have a faux page.js setup implemented at the moment as I don't intend to actually use it within my app. It's setup how I'd imagine doing it if I were going to use it.

Getting repo data from github API and using reduce() and map() on the repos to arrange and sort.
