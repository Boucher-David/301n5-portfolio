# Class 04 Notes



Added handlebars into my portfolio. Users can click the nav bar, and then the correct handlebars template is loaded into the #main-content div. I have created files to split CSS into SMACSS modules, although I've yet to really dig in with splitting up the code.

Next thing will be to come up with actual website content, alter the handlebars template to accommodate, and then put the correct data into the handlebars data JSON files.
