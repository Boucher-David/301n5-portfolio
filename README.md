# Portfolio 10 & 11

IIFE used. I'd like to keep the app.js setup I currently have. Please suggest a good way to use .map() on a get request because it seems difficult. Be tough to implement the desired functions the way I have set it up.

I can re-submit if that's a big issue, but I hope you can give me a pass because of how i'm doing things.  

I also handle navigation in a different way; I load templates in based on the clicks on the nav bar. I've put in commented out code for page.js setup as it should be. Hoping this is ok.
